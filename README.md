A minimalist Chrome extension that lets users mark micro-achievements for the day and receive ironic praise for it.

## 🚀 Description

"Bare Minimum Hero" is an extension for those who understand that sometimes doing just something is already a win. No complicated habit trackers, productivity graphs, or annoying reminders - just press a button at the end of the day if you've done at least the minimum.

## ✨ Features

- Simple interface with one question and one button
- Ironic, motivational praise messages
- "Hero points" counter to track your consistency
- Daily reminder (which you can ignore)
- No intrusive gamification or guilt

## 📁 Folder of Feelings — Code Breakdown

We like clean code. Even when everything else is on fire.  
Here's where the emotional brain of **Bare Minimum Hero** lives:

---

#### `quotes.js`  
🧠 **Core Quotes for Daily Validation**  
The heart of the app.  
This is where your daily "well-done-for-existing" moment gets randomly summoned.

> Example:  
> "Bare minimum? Bare legend."  
> "You're not failing — you're surviving with flair."

---

#### `tips.js`  
💡 **Barely Useful Tips**  
Things your therapist wouldn't say, but probably should.  
Perfectly unhelpful. Accidentally brilliant.

> Example:  
> "Deleting a file = emotional release."  
> "Lying horizontally still counts as existing."

---

#### `streak-quotes.js`  
🔥 **Streak Mode Announcements**  
These quotes kick in when you dare to do the bare minimum **multiple days in a row**.  
Yes, it's streak-based self-esteem.  
No, we're not sorry.

> Example:  
> "🥈 Resilient Waffle unlocked."  
> "🏆 Burnout? Never Heard Of Her."

---

#### `emergency-quotes.js`  
🚨 **Emergency Validation Monologues**  
Long, dramatic, over-the-top praise for when you absolutely need to feel like a legend  
(because you drank water *and* opened your laptop today).

> Example:  
> "You didn't break today. That makes you legendary."  
> "The system was not designed for you to thrive. Yet — you clicked. Heroic."

---

#### `mystery-bonus.js`  
🎁 **Random Reward Surprises**  
Unexpected digital gifts that appear when you least expect them.  
They do nothing. They mean nothing. They just exist to make you smile.

> Example:  
> "🧠 Brain Cell Backup — For when the last one quits"  
> "🔮 Crystal Ball of 'Maybe Tomorrow' — Shows you 24 hours of continued existence"

---

#### `html2canvas.min.js`  
📸 **Image Generation Magic**  
Transforms your validation into shareable content.  
Because if a tree falls in the forest and nobody posts about it, did it even happen?

> Example:  
> That time you completed 1/10th of your to-do list  
> But the image makes it look like you conquered the world

---

This app doesn't just store strings.  
It stores **hope, sarcasm, and deeply personal coping mechanisms.**  
**Use with caution. Or not. You do you.**

## 🔥 Streak Mode

Every time you show up and click, we remember.  
Not in a creepy way — in a "we love patterns" way.

- 🧠 3-Day Streak: "Consistently Mediocre"
- 💪 7-Day Streak: "Resilient Waffle"
- 🧃 14-Day Streak: "Certified Non-Quitter"
- ☕️ 30-Day Streak: "Burnout? Never Heard Of Her"
- 😎 69 Days: "Nice. That's Commitment."

Streak Mode exists to make you care just enough not to skip tomorrow.

Because who needs a screaming owl when you have a tired star silently respecting your effort?

## 🎁 Mystery Bonuses

Sometimes (rarely, unpredictably), you'll trigger a Barely Legendary Bonus.  
These make no difference. They change nothing.  
They're just a small unexpected joy, like finding a forgotten cookie in your pocket.

Examples:
- 🥯 Emotional Bagel — Nourishment for your digital soul
- 🧸 Emotional Support Pixel — It's watching over your screen  
- 🧶 Digital Comfort Yarn — Knitted from the finest validation strings

These don't improve your life in any tangible way.  
But then again, neither does doom-scrolling, and you still do that.

## 📸 Shareable Moments

After you get your daily validation, you can download a beautiful shareable image.

Why? Because sometimes doing just one thing deserves to be commemorated.  
And if you share it on social media, we get more users. Win-win.

Features:
- One-click image generation
- Beautiful quotes on a clean background
- Easy to download PNG format
- Perfect for low-key bragging about simply surviving

No one needs to know that all you did was answer one email.  
Let them think you're thriving.

**Bare Minimum Hero** is a Chrome extension for people who are *not* crushing it, *not* optimizing every second, and *definitely not* building a second brain.  
It's for the real heroes — the ones who **wake up, do one thing, and don't combust.**

## 🚀 What It Does

- ✅ Asks you once a day:  
  > "Did you do the bare minimum today?"
- ✨ You click: **"Yes. Barely."**
- 🎉 It gives you a randomly sarcastic but emotionally validating compliment
- 🧠 It tracks your *hero points* (because you *exist* and that's basically a superpower)
- 🔒 Only once per day. No cheating. This isn't CrossFit.

## 🧾 Why It Exists

Because **life is hard, productivity is overrated**, and sometimes you just need a system that says:  
> "👏 You did one thing. Wow. Incredible. Hero."

No dashboards.  
No tracking software.  
No guilt.

Just one click.  
One moment of dignity.  
One sarcastic round of applause.  
Every day.

## 🧠 Use Cases

- Wrote one email? ✅  
- Cleaned a dish? ✅  
- Didn't cry at work? ✅  
- Resisted urge to start side project at 3am? ✅  
- Stared into abyss but blinked first? ✅

**You're a Bare Minimum Hero. And this extension knows it.**
