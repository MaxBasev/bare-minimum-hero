# 🦸‍♂️ Bare Minimum Hero

### You didn’t win.  
### You didn’t hustle.  
### But you **clicked**.  
**And that’s enough.**

---

**Bare Minimum Hero** is a Chrome extension for people who are *not* crushing it, *not* optimizing every second, and *definitely not* building a second brain.  
It’s for the real heroes — the ones who **wake up, do one thing, and don’t combust.**

## 🚀 What It Does

- ✅ Asks you once a day:  
  > “Did you do the bare minimum today?”
- ✨ You click: **“Yes. Barely.”**
- 🎉 It gives you a randomly sarcastic but emotionally validating compliment
- 🧠 It tracks your *hero points* (because you *exist* and that’s basically a superpower)
- 🔒 Only once per day. No cheating. This isn’t CrossFit.

## 🧾 Why It Exists

Because **life is hard, productivity is overrated**, and sometimes you just need a system that says:  
> “👏 You did one thing. Wow. Incredible. Hero.”

No dashboards.  
No tracking software.  
No guilt.

Just one click.  
One moment of dignity.  
One sarcastic round of applause.  
Every day.

## 🧠 Use Cases

- Wrote one email? ✅  
- Cleaned a dish? ✅  
- Didn’t cry at work? ✅  
- Resisted urge to start side project at 3am? ✅  
- Stared into abyss but blinked first? ✅

**You're a Bare Minimum Hero. And this extension knows it.**

## 🧙‍♂️ Made by

A tired genius with a keyboard.  
Helped by an AI who’s probably too emotionally invested in this project.  
Yes, it's ironic.
