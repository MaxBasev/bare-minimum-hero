A minimalist Chrome extension that lets users mark micro-achievements for the day and receive ironic praise for it.

## 🚀 Description

"Bare Minimum Hero" is an extension for those who understand that sometimes doing just something is already a win. No complicated habit trackers, productivity graphs, or annoying reminders - just press a button at the end of the day if you've done at least the minimum.

## ✨ Features

- Simple interface with one question and one button
- Ironic, motivational praise messages
- "Hero points" counter to track your consistency
- Daily reminder (which you can ignore)
- No intrusive gamification or guilt

## 📁 Folder of Feelings — Code Breakdown

We like clean code. Even when everything else is on fire.  
Here's where the emotional brain of **Bare Minimum Hero** lives:

---

#### `quotes.js`  
🧠 **Core Quotes for Daily Validation**  
The heart of the app.  
This is where your daily "well-done-for-existing" moment gets randomly summoned.

> Example:  
> "Bare minimum? Bare legend."  
> "You're not failing — you're surviving with flair."

---

#### `tips.js`  
💡 **Barely Useful Tips**  
Things your therapist wouldn't say, but probably should.  
Perfectly unhelpful. Accidentally brilliant.

> Example:  
> "Deleting a file = emotional release."  
> "Lying horizontally still counts as existing."

---

#### `streak-quotes.js`  
🔥 **Streak Mode Announcements**  
These quotes kick in when you dare to do the bare minimum **multiple days in a row**.  
Yes, it's streak-based self-esteem.  
No, we're not sorry.

> Example:  
> "🥈 Resilient Waffle unlocked."  
> "🏆 Burnout? Never Heard Of Her."

---

#### `emergency-quotes.js`  
🚨 **Emergency Validation Monologues**  
Long, dramatic, over-the-top praise for when you absolutely need to feel like a legend  
(because you drank water *and* opened your laptop today).

> Example:  
> "You didn't break today. That makes you legendary."  
> "The system was not designed for you to thrive. Yet — you clicked. Heroic."

---

This app doesn't just store strings.  
It stores **hope, sarcasm, and deeply personal coping mechanisms.**  
**Use with caution. Or not. You do you.**

## 🔥 Streak Mode

Every time you show up and click, we remember.  
Not in a creepy way — in a "we love patterns" way.

- 🧠 3-Day Streak: "Consistently Mediocre"
- 💪 7-Day Streak: "Resilient Waffle"
- 🧃 14-Day Streak: "Certified Non-Quitter"
- ☕️ 30-Day Streak: "Burnout? Never Heard Of Her"
- 😎 69 Days: "Nice. That's Commitment."

Streak Mode exists to make you care just enough not to skip tomorrow.

Because who needs a screaming owl when you have a tired star silently respecting your effort?

**Bare Minimum Hero** is a Chrome extension for people who are *not* crushing it, *not* optimizing every second, and *definitely not* building a second brain.  
It's for the real heroes — the ones who **wake up, do one thing, and don't combust.**

## 🚀 What It Does

- ✅ Asks you once a day:  
  > "Did you do the bare minimum today?"
- ✨ You click: **"Yes. Barely."**
- 🎉 It gives you a randomly sarcastic but emotionally validating compliment
- 🧠 It tracks your *hero points* (because you *exist* and that's basically a superpower)
- 🔒 Only once per day. No cheating. This isn't CrossFit.

## 🧾 Why It Exists

Because **life is hard, productivity is overrated**, and sometimes you just need a system that says:  
> "👏 You did one thing. Wow. Incredible. Hero."

No dashboards.  
No tracking software.  
No guilt.

Just one click.  
One moment of dignity.  
One sarcastic round of applause.  
Every day.

## 🧠 Use Cases

- Wrote one email? ✅  
- Cleaned a dish? ✅  
- Didn't cry at work? ✅  
- Resisted urge to start side project at 3am? ✅
